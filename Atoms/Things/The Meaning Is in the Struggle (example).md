Three thinkers who never met reached the same conclusion: an easy life has no meaning.

[[Man's Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl|Viktor Frankl]] discovered it in Auschwitz — the prisoners who survived weren't the strongest but the ones who had a purpose. A book to write, a child to find, something worth enduring one more day for. "He who has a *why* to live can bear almost any *how*." The flip side: whoever has every comfort but no *why* collapses.

[[Industrial Society and Its Future - Ted Kaczynski|Kaczynski]] analyzed it as a system — the "power process." Humans need real goals that demand genuine effort. When technology solves our basic needs, we invent artificial goals ("surrogate activities") that never truly satisfy. The depression epidemic in the developed world isn't a bug. It's a feature.

[[Jiang Xueqin]] says it with brutal clarity: "We're here on this world to expand consciousness — and that means a life of struggle, hardship, and pain." We chose comfort over the mountain. No mountain, no summit. No summit, no meaning.

The convergence is clear: suffering itself isn't good, but struggling for something meaningful is what gives life purpose. Remove the struggle — with technology, money, comfort — and you remove the meaning. And a human without meaning self-destructs.

Now think about AI. It doesn't just automate work — it automates effort. It automates the struggle. It automates exactly what Frankl, Kaczynski, and Jiang say gives life meaning. [[Her - Spike Jonze]] showed this with kindness. [[Gattaca - Andrew Niccol]] showed the antidote — the human spirit that refuses to be optimized. [[Brave New World - Aldous Huxley]] predicted the whole thing in 1932.

The question is: what's your mountain?
