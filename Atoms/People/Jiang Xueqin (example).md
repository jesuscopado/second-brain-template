Professor and creator of [Predictive History](https://www.youtube.com/@predictivehistory) on YouTube. Chinese-Canadian immigrant, Yale-educated, worked as journalist, documentarian, teacher, and UN consultant. After years of cognitive dissonance — the world didn't work as Yale taught him — he developed a framework combining [[game theory]] with psychology to analyze and predict geopolitics.

His approach, which he calls "psycho-history" (inspired by [[Foundation - Isaac Asimov|Asimov's Foundation]]), starts from a premise: the best ideas don't win — the players who optimize their strategy based on personality, incentives, and circumstances do. Understanding the world means understanding the players.

But Jiang goes beyond geopolitics. He has a powerful spiritual dimension: consciousness as the base of reality, Plato's cave allegory, the spiritual decline of the West, and the resilience that faith provides against materialism. For him, the greatest act of rebellion is rejecting the constructed reality and creating your own.

Recommends reading [[1984 - George Orwell]] and [[Brave New World - Aldous Huxley]] as eerily relevant to the AI age.

Discovered him through [[Game Theory, Geopolitics & Consciousness - Jiang Xueqin|this interview]] — someone worth learning from in depth.
