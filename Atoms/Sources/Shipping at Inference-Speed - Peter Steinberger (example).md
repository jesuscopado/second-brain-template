## Overview

Peter Steinberger describes how he stopped reading the code he ships. He uses AI to write, review, and deploy — and his shipping speed has multiplied.

## Key ideas

- **Doesn't read his own code**: Trusts AI to generate and validate
- **Inference-speed shipping**: Delivery speed no longer depends on how fast you write, but on how fast the model generates
- **Paradigm shift**: The developer goes from code writer to agent director

A concrete example of [[Agentic Coding]] in practice.
