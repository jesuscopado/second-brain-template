## Overview

Orwell's dystopia of total surveillance, thought control, and manufactured reality. Big Brother doesn't just watch — he rewrites history, controls language, and makes independent thought impossible. The Party's goal isn't power for a purpose. Power is the purpose.

## Key ideas

- **Newspeak**: Reduce language, reduce thought. If you can't articulate dissent, you can't think it. The AI parallel: when algorithms curate what you see, they shape what you think.
- **Doublethink**: Holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously and accepting both. We already do this — "AI will replace jobs" and "AI will create new jobs" in the same breath.
- **The telescreen**: Surveillance that watches and broadcasts simultaneously. Every smartphone with a camera and a feed.
- **"Who controls the past controls the future"**: When information is editable and filterable, truth becomes a function of who runs the algorithm.

## Highlights

> "Big Brother is watching you."

> "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."

Recommended by [[Jiang Xueqin]] as essential reading for understanding the current moment. Pairs with [[Brave New World - Aldous Huxley]] — Orwell feared control through pain, Huxley feared control through pleasure. Both were right.
