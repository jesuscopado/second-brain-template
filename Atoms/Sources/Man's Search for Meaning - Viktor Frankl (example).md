## Overview

Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl survived Auschwitz and wrote this book in nine days. Part one: his experience in the concentration camps. Part two: the foundations of logotherapy, his psychotherapeutic school. The central thesis — meaning, not pleasure or power, is the primary motivational force of human beings. Even in extreme suffering, a person can find meaning.

## Key ideas

- **The last human freedom**: Everything can be taken from a man except the freedom to choose his attitude in any circumstance. That inner freedom is indestructible.
- **Logotherapy**: The will to meaning is the fundamental human motivation (vs. Freud's will to pleasure or Nietzsche's will to power).
- **Three paths to meaning**: Through work/creation, through love/experience, and through unavoidable suffering. Suffering ceases to be suffering when it finds a meaning.
- **The existential vacuum**: When there's no meaning, boredom, addiction, aggression, and depression appear.

## Highlights

> "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."

> "Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning."

Converges with [[Industrial Society and Its Future - Ted Kaczynski]] and [[Jiang Xueqin]] on the same insight — see [[The Meaning Is in the Struggle]].
