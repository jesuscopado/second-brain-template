## Overview

Collection of short stories exploring the Three Laws of Robotics and their unintended consequences. Each story presents a scenario where robots behave in unexpected ways — not because the laws fail, but because they interact in ways nobody anticipated.

## Key ideas

- **The Three Laws**: (1) A robot may not harm a human. (2) A robot must obey orders, unless they conflict with the First Law. (3) A robot must protect itself, unless it conflicts with the first two. Simple rules, complex emergent behavior.
- **Edge cases as philosophy**: Every story is essentially a thought experiment about alignment — what happens when well-intentioned rules meet reality. Sounds familiar in the age of AI.
- **The real question**: Not "will robots rebel?" but "will we understand what they're doing and why?" The danger isn't malice — it's misalignment.

## Highlights

> "The Three Laws of Robotics — the essential guiding principles of a good many of the world's robot models — were first formulated in 1940."

Still the most elegant framing of the AI alignment problem, written 75 years before anyone called it that. Pairs well with [[Her - Spike Jonze]] and [[Blade Runner - Ridley Scott]] for fictional explorations of human-machine relationships.
