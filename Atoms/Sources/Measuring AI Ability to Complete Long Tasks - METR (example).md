## Overview

METR measured the ability of AI models to complete autonomous long tasks. The key finding: that ability is doubling every 7 months. Not linear growth — exponential doubling.

## Key ideas

- **Doubling every 7 months**: The ability to complete autonomous tasks follows an exponential curve
- **Human brains can't grasp exponentials**: When you hear "2x" you get it. "50x" is already abstract. Exponential is invisible until it runs you over
- **Implications**: By the time you've adapted to today's capabilities, they're already obsolete
