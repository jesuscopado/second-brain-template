## Overview

In a world where your DNA determines your destiny, Vincent — genetically "inferior" — refuses to accept the hand he was dealt. He assumes a valid's identity and fights his way into the Gattaca space program through sheer will, discipline, and effort. The system says he can't. He does it anyway.

## Key ideas

- **Genetics as class system**: Your genome is your resume. Invalids are locked out of opportunity not by ability, but by probability. Replace "genetics" with "AI-generated credentials" and you get tomorrow.
- **The triumph of will over optimization**: Vincent beats the system not by being better — by wanting it more. The film's thesis: human spirit can't be predicted by data. See [[The Meaning Is in the Struggle]].
- **"There is no gene for the human spirit"**: The film's tagline and its entire argument. No algorithm, no genetic model, no AI can account for determination.
- **The swimming scene**: Vincent and his genetically superior brother swim out to sea. Anton asks how Vincent keeps winning. "I never saved anything for the swim back." Pure struggle, zero optimization.

## Highlights

> "I never saved anything for the swim back."

The most beautiful argument for human effort in cinema. Pairs with [[Her - Spike Jonze]] (what AI takes from us) and [[Blade Runner - Ridley Scott]] (what makes us human).
