## Overview

Rick Deckard hunts replicants — bioengineered beings virtually identical to humans — in a rain-soaked 2019 Los Angeles. But the replicants aren't the villains. Roy Batty, their leader, just wants to live longer. He has four years. He's seen things we people wouldn't believe. And he's more alive than anyone hunting him.

## Key ideas

- **What makes us human?**: If a replicant can feel love, fear death, and create memories, what separates it from us? The film never answers. That's the point.
- **Empathy as the test**: The Voight-Kampff test measures emotional response. The irony — Deckard, the human, is emotionally dead. The replicants are full of feeling.
- **The "tears in rain" monologue**: Roy Batty's final speech is cinema's most human moment — delivered by a machine. All those moments, lost in time, like tears in rain.
- **Mortality gives meaning**: The replicants' four-year lifespan makes them desperate to live. Humans with unlimited time sleepwalk through existence. See [[The Meaning Is in the Struggle]].
