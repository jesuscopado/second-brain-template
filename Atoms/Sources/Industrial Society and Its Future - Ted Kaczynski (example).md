## Overview

Ted Kaczynski's manifesto, published in 1995. A radical essay against industrial-technological society. Regardless of the author's actions, his analysis of how technology destroys human autonomy and empties life of meaning is extraordinarily lucid.

## Key ideas

- **The power process**: Human beings need goals that require real effort to achieve. The process of struggling for something — not the result — provides psychological satisfaction. Remove that process and depression, anxiety, and purposelessness appear.
- **Surrogate activities**: When technology solves all basic needs (food, shelter, security), people create artificial goals — hobbies, corporate careers, superficial activism — that never truly satisfy because they aren't real needs.
- **The technology trap**: Each technological advance seems individually liberating, but collectively they trap us in a system where we depend on technology and lose autonomy. You can't "choose" not to participate.
- **Freedom vs. comfort**: Industrial society offers comfort in exchange for freedom. Most people accept the trade without realizing what they lose.

## Highlights

> "When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves."

Written in 1995, before smartphones, social media, or AI. Reads like prophecy. Converges with [[Man's Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl]] and [[Jiang Xueqin]] — see [[The Meaning Is in the Struggle]].
