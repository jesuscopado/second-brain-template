## Overview

Asimov's masterpiece about Hari Seldon, a mathematician who develops "psychohistory" — a science that predicts the behavior of large populations using statistics and psychology. When he foresees the fall of the Galactic Empire and 30,000 years of barbarism, he creates the Foundation to shorten the dark age to a single millennium.

## Key ideas

- **Psychohistory**: You can't predict what one person will do, but you can predict what billions will do. Large-scale human behavior follows mathematical patterns — like gas molecules in a container.
- **The Seldon Plan**: Long-term planning across centuries, with "Seldon Crises" — inevitable turning points where the Foundation faces a choice, but the math guarantees only one viable path.
- **Knowledge as power**: The Foundation survives not through military force but by being the sole keeper of scientific knowledge in a collapsing galaxy.

## Highlights

> "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."

The concept of psychohistory directly inspired [[Jiang Xueqin]]'s framework for analyzing geopolitics through game theory and psychology.
