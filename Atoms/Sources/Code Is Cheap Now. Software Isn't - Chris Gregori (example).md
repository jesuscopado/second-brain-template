## Overview

Chris Gregori argues that code itself no longer holds value — what matters is software: the product vision, design, user experience, distribution.

## Key ideas

- **Code as commodity**: Writing code is no longer the bottleneck — anyone can generate it with AI
- **Software ≠ code**: The value is in knowing what to build, for whom, and how to distribute it
- **Implication for developers**: Product, design, and business skills matter more than ever

Pairs with [[Shipping at Inference-Speed - Peter Steinberger]] — one describes the speed, the other describes what actually matters.
