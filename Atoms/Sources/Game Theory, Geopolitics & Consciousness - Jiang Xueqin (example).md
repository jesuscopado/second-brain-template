## Overview

Interview with [[Jiang Xueqin]] on the "All Quiet on the Inner Front" channel. Jiang applies game theory combined with psychology to geopolitics, predicts world events, and delivers a powerful segment on consciousness, Plato's cave, spirituality, and the decline of Western civilization.

## Key ideas

- **Psycho-history as framework**: Inspired by [[Foundation - Isaac Asimov|Asimov's Foundation]], Jiang built a system combining game theory with individual psychology to predict geopolitics. It's not about which ideas win — it's about understanding each player's motivations and optimal strategy.
- **Consciousness as base reality**: Whoever controls collective attention and consciousness controls reality. Money, media, education, and now AI are mechanisms for directing that attention.
- **Three responses to seeing the truth**: Stay outside, go back and tell people (they'll laugh), or use it for your own benefit. Those in power choose the third.
- **Spiritual resilience**: What kills people isn't disaster — it's the inability to be resilient. Faith and spirituality are the foundation of survival when everything collapses.

## Highlights

> "Your greatest act of rebellion is to deny the reality before you and establish your own reality."

> "We're consciousness. We're here on this world to expand the consciousness of ourselves as well as the universe. And that means a life of struggle, hardship, and pain."

This interview led to [[The Meaning Is in the Struggle]] — the convergence between Jiang, [[Man's Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl|Frankl]], and [[Industrial Society and Its Future - Ted Kaczynski|Kaczynski]].
