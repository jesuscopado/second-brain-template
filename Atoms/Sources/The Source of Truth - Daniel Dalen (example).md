## Overview

[[Daniel Dalen]] explains how he structures his year using a single document he calls the "Source of Truth" — a living document he opens every morning to remind himself what matters and where he's headed.

## Key ideas

- **Year intention**: Not goals, but the mindset you want to carry through the year (e.g., "be more intentional").
- **Bigger picture**: 4-5 big goals without details — the direction, not the plan.
- **Non-negotiables**: What you won't sacrifice no matter what (health, family, etc.).
- **Month by month**: Concrete tasks by area that you check off as you go.
- **Out of scope**: At the end of each month, write down what you did that was NOT planned — stay flexible, accept opportunities.

## Highlights

> "At a certain stage, it all becomes about what you say no to."

> "This clarity usually leads to action."

This system inspired the Source of Truth template used in this vault.
