## Overview

Karpathy declares "vibe coding" passé and introduces "agentic engineering" — in a single year, the entire paradigm shifted.

## Key ideas

- **Vibe coding is dead**: He coined the term in February 2025 and considers it outdated by February 2026
- **Agentic engineering**: The new paradigm — you don't write code, you direct agents that write it for you
- **Speed of change**: An entire paradigm was born and died in 12 months

The clearest marker of how fast [[Agentic Coding]] is evolving.
