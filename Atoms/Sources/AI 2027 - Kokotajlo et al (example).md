## Overview

A detailed scenario tracing a line from current AI capabilities to superintelligence by late 2027. Not science fiction — an analysis based on current trends extrapolated.

## Key ideas

- **Concrete timeline**: From current models to superintelligence in ~2 years
- **Based on real trends**: Not speculation — extrapolation from METR data, benchmarks, and observed capabilities
- **Systemic implications**: If the scenario plays out even partially, the world changes irreversibly

The most comprehensive attempt at mapping what comes next. See also [[Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks - METR]].
