## Check-in

**Sleep**: 7 hours, slept well
**State**: Good energy, ready to start
**On my mind**: Nothing major, just excited to set up my second brain

**Gratitude**:
1. Having time to set this up
2. Coffee
3. A clear morning with no meetings

## Focus for today

Set up the vault and get familiar with the system.

## Pending tasks
