## Year intention

**Be more intentional.** Not just achieve more — live more. Be present, enjoy the process.

## Bigger picture

1. **Travel more** — see new places, broaden perspective
2. **Build something meaningful** — a project that matters
3. **Grow the brand** — share what I learn with others

## Non-negotiables

- **Sleep 7+ hours** — non-negotiable
- **Exercise 3x per week** — body enables mind
- **Time outdoors** — sunlight, walks, nature

## Daily routines

### Morning
- Get sunlight first thing
- 10 min meditation or journaling

### Evening
- Screens off by 23:00
- Read before sleep

## This month (January 2026)

**Brand:**
