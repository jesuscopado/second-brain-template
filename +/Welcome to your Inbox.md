This is your **inbox** — the place for quick captures that haven't been processed yet.

When you have a thought, a link, or a note that you don't know where to put, drop it here. Later, process it:

- **Idea or concept?** → Move to `Atoms/Things/`
- **A person?** → Move to `Atoms/People/`
- **A source (book, article, video)?** → Move to `Atoms/Sources/`
- **A task?** → Add a checkbox `- [ ]` to the relevant note

Or just use `/braindump` and let Claude sort it for you.

> This is an example note. You can delete it once you understand how the inbox works.
